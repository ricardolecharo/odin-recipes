# odin-recipes
Project Overview
Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This website is a basic recipe collection created using HTML. It includes an index page with links to individual recipe pages. The goal of this project is to practice foundational HTML skills, such as creating links, structuring content, and using basic tags like headers, paragraphs, and lists.

The website may look quite simple for now, but the focus is on the structure and semantics of HTML. We will revisit this project later to enhance its appearance and functionality with CSS.

Next Steps
Once you've completed the basic structure of the website, you'll want to revisit this project in the future to add styling with CSS and potentially JavaScript for added interactivity.
